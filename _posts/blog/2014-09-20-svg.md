I am quite interested in SVG technology because it is very compact in contrast to normal image formats. But it is only suitable for certain type of images. In this post I'll test whether GitHub server can host it. There are two types of SVG, the normal *svg* and the compressed *svgz*. In my case the sizes are about **36kb** and **3k**.

## How it should be

Normal image

![svg]({{ site.resources }}/images/bloodVomittingGame.svg "Blood Vomitting Game")

Compressed image

![svgz]({{ site.resources }}/images/bloodVomittingGame.svgz "Blood Vomitting Game")

## GitHub

Normal image

![svg](/images/bloodVomittingGame.svg "Blood Vomitting Game")

Compressed image

![svgz](/images/bloodVomittingGame.svgz "Blood Vomitting Game")

## Result

GitHub cannot host compressed *svgz*. But it should be enough, because the site is normally compressed before sending to the user. 

To use external resources I added *resources* to *_config.yml*, which is pointing to the location of my resources. Now I can use this for bigger files without stressing my GitHub too much.

The reason why *svgz* can be displayed is because I can modify *.htaccess*. People would think *.htaccess* was not important on GitHub because it is public anyway, but you can use it for other purposes! Here is the content of my *.htaccess* file in the resource folder:

~~~
AddType image/svg+xml svg
AddType image/svg+xml svgz
AddEncoding x-gzip .svgz
~~~

The 1st line can be omitted if *svg* is already supported. If you have an idea how to use something like *.htaccess* on GitHub, please let me know!
