I am quite interested in SVG technology because it is very compact in contrast to normal image formats. But it is only suitable for certain type of images. In this post I'll test whether GitHub server can host it. There are two types of svg, the normal one *svg* and the compressed one *svgz*. In my case it is about **36kb** and **3k**.

## How it should be

![normal](http://ranmeus.byethost33.com/images/bloodVomittingGame.svg "Blood Vomitting Game")
Normal image

![compressed](http://ranmeus.byethost33.com/images/bloodVomittingGame.svgz "Blood Vomitting Game")
Compressed image

## GitHub

![normal](bloodVomittingGame.svg "Blood Vomitting Game")
Normal image

![compressed](bloodVomittingGame.svgz "Blood Vomitting Game")
Compressed image
