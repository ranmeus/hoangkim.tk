I am quite interested in SVG technology because it is very compact in contrast to normal image formats. But it is only suitable for certain type of images. In this post I'll test whether GitHub server can host it. There are two types of SVG, the normal *svg* and the compressed *svgz*. In my case the sizes are about **36kb** and **3k**.

## How it should be

Normal image

![svgz](http://ranmeus.byethost33.com/images/bloodVomittingGame.svgz "Blood Vomitting Game")

Compressed image

## GitHub

![svg](bloodVomittingGame.svg "Blood Vomitting Game")

Normal image

![svgz](bloodVomittingGame.svgz "Blood Vomitting Game")

Compressed image

## Result

It seems GitHub can't make it. So I have to host the SVGs somewhere else.
