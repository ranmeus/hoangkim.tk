Try to find out more about me? Well, you are in the wrong place!

This website is created for me to try out things. I like to blog and I like markdown, so there are two versions of blog. The ghost blog is hosted externally, but I am gonna ditch it since its markdown technique isn't advanced.

This website is hosted on GitHub using Jekyll. The theme is [So Simple][1], which looks nice. Explore this link you can find out how I construct this site (mainly it is for me :D).

Look around!!!
